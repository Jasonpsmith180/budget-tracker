# budget-tracker

## Description
Keeping track of finances can be hard especially when you can just swipe that little piece of plastic and not think about it. But that is not a very responsible way to think about your finances, so I made a budget tracker app! This app allows the user to enter transactions that add and remove funds when they are entered, then those funds are represented graphically to see if the user has a net increase or decrease in their financial situation. The app uses mongoDB and mongoose to store the user's financial transactions, indexedDB to store any transactions that are made when the user does not have an internet connection, and it is also a progressive web app so it can be downloaded on to a phone or desktop!  

The app is published at [Budget Tracker](https://cryptic-eyrie-12746.herokuapp.com/).
